      <p>You can only get a shielding note if all of these apply:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>you're at high risk from coronavirus – you received a letter advising you to take extra steps to protect yourself (shield)</li>
        <li>you work in an area where you’re advised to shield, but do not live there</li>
        <li>you cannot work from home or outside of an area where you’re advised to shield</li>
        <li>you live in England</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you live and work in the same area you will get an email or letter telling you if you need to shield.</p>
      <p>If you are not sure if this applies to you, speak to your GP surgery, your employer or <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/local-restrictions-areas-with-an-outbreak-of-coronavirus-covid-19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">visit GOV.UK to find out which areas have local restrictions (link opens in a new window)</a>.</p>
